/*
 * 
 * Maintains insertion order and allows duplicate and null values.
Dynamically grows its size when capacity is exceeded.
Implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces.
Vector is a Legacy class that was introduced in early versions of Java.
Thread-safe: All methods are synchronized for safe multi-threaded access.
ArrayList is preferred over vector in general when in-built thread synchronization is not required..
